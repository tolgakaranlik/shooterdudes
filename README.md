# shooterdudes
An OpenGL based custom graphics engine and a sample game made with it. Works on Android platform and made with 100% Java. Contains full source code of the engine and the game itself.

This project is not being maintained and has known issues. This repository is being published for two purposes:
1. My personal reference
2. To help people who are trying to develop similar things. Such people can copy the source code they see here but all assets are forbidden to be copied or used in anywhere else for any purposes.

Please do not ask me to:
- Correct some issue in the code
- Explain why things have been done in this way
- Describe the function of some fragment within the porject
- Write additional code
- Refactor some part of the project in order to work compatible with yours

I am really busy on 105% of my time so I cannot teach anyone anything. The only favor I can make for you is to share my code so you can see for yourself how things to be done and/or copy any fragment you need.
